<div class="text">
<p> I want to make a HTML website about Poland. The website would be a guide for anyone who wants to visit Poland. I am thinking of having a map of Poland
    on main page. On that map there would be couple main cities worth visiting including my hometwon. When you click on a specific city it would take the user 
    to another page specifically designated to that city. I would include gallery of pictures, what to see in that city, recommendation of restaurants and 
    must try local food for that region. As of right now I have to figure out how to implemet everything and hopefully I will be successful. For the restaurants 
    I am thinking to add a restaurants page so a user can easily access it and review menu and other contents. I think the first main important thing for me would
    be figuring out how to direct from my main page to secondary page after clicking on a specific city. Also, creating a photo gallery might be challenging as well.
    I am planning to start early because I have a lot thing to accomplish.
